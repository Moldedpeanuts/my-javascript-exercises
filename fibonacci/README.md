# Fibonacci function
This exercise wants us to write a function that takes a number or string that contains a number argument (lets call it arg) that specifies the position of a number inside a fibonacci sequence.

A fibonacci sequence is basically an integer sequence of numbers from which each number (aside from the two first) is equal to the sum of the two previous numbers.
