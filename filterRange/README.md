# filterRange function
A function called filterRange(arr, a, b) that gets an array, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return the result as an array.

The function should not modify the array, instead it should return the new array.
a and b could be any random integer numbers passed as arguments to the function.

## Pseudocode
We will implement the filter() array method that filters out any elements that meet a certain condition provided by our function.
The condition would be any array element that is >= a AND <= b .
