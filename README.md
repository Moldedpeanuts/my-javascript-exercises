# JavaScript Exercises Collection
JavaScript Exercises is a personal repository containing a variety of small coding challenges and practice problems, all written in vanilla JavaScript.
This project is focused on improving core programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts.

It serves as a "workout journal" for growing as a developer â€” perfect for daily coding practice!


## Project Features

- Basic JavaScript Problems: Practice with variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.

- Intermediate Challenges: Work with arrays, objects, higher-order functions, and string manipulation.

- Hands-On Practice: Each exercise is written manually â€” no frameworks, no libraries.

- Clean Code Style: Emphasis on readable and efficient solutions.


## How to Use

- Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moldedpeanuts/my-javascript-exercises.git
```

- Open the files: Open individual .js files in your favorite code editor.


## Future Improvements

-  Add automated test cases for each exercise.
-  Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) labels.
-  Create a webpage interface to run and display solutions.
-  Add explanations or step-by-step breakdowns inside each solution.

ðŸš€ Happy Coding!
